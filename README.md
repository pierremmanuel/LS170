### LS170 (Networking Foundations)

The focus of this course is network communication, and how that forms the basis for the way networked applications function. It's somewhat more theory-based than other courses you have encountered thus far, but the concepts covered here are fundamental to understanding how web applications work at the most basic level. It's important that you clearly understand these concepts. You will leverage and build upon them, not only in later courses in this program but for the rest of your career.

As we progress through the course we will look to build a mental model of communication between networked applications as the interaction of multiple different protocols (systems of rules). Starting with what actually constitutes the internet at a physical level, we will work our way up through various layers of abstraction to gain a deeper understanding of what is actually happening under the hood when applications communicate with each other over the network.
